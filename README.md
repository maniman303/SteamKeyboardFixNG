# SteamKeyboardFixNG

A simple C++ Skyrim SE/AE plugin using [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG). It's main task is to workaround the issue, where Steam Decks virtual keyboard is crashing the game on close.

Workaround does NOT work in main menu, due to Steam login happening under the hood etc.

### Release
TBD

### Build
The `CMakeLists.txt` file has hardcoded path for SteamworksAPI header files.
